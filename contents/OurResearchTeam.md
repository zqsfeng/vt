<!-- # Our Research Team -->

Our research team is dedicated to investigating the vibration of structures and their control, focusing on wind-induced vibrations, structural health monitoring, and vibration control. We employ a range of methods, including theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, experimental studies, and field measurements, integrating expertise and tools from structural dynamics, Bayesian inference, intelligent optimization, machine learning, digital twins, smart sensors, and innovative vibration control devices. 

Our research aims to understand the vibration characteristics and mechanisms of infrastructure—such as bridges and wind turbine structures—under complex environmental conditions and loads, including ambient and mechanical excitations, temperature variations, wind, waves, vehicles, pedestrians, and earthquakes. We perform system modeling and response analysis, structural optimization, system identification, and condition assessment, while proposing reliable, efficient, and durable vibration control devices to enhance the safety, stability, durability, and intelligence of these structures. 

We warmly invite dedicated, diligent, and explorative students and postdocs to join our research team. Let us work together, delve into research, and enjoy the joy of making novel contributions! We also welcome colleagues from both domestic and international institutions to connect with us for collaborations and exchanges.
